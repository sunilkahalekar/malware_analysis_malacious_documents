## 1. Introdunction to Course
Hello and welcome to fundamentals of malware, analysis of malicious documents.

My name is Sunil Kahalekar.

Did you know that you could infect your computer just by opening a PDA or office document? PDAF and office documents are commonly used as the first stage of malware attack. In the second stage the embedded scripts in the document itself may download malicious binaries like ransomware or remote access tools to compromised your system. Everyone uses documents, so you need to be aware of the dangers and how to detect malicious documents.

learning objectives

Here, I will show you how to examine PDF, Microsoft Office documents, what tools to use and techniques of how to analyze them.

By the end of this course, you will know how to determine if a document is malicious and what it does to compromise some so that you can protect your network eg organization.

What you will learn in this course: You will learn to install remnants of Linux virtual machine, identify PDF, identify Microsoft Office documents and their versions.

A strict document metadata.

Basic Linux commands Melbourne analysis a extract bad objects in JavaScript from PDA extract VBA macros scripts from office documents.

JavaScript and Web based groups automate analyses of documents.

View and give up America's office mako's identifying Mikac origin of intelligence documents used Usera to identify malicious patterns and signatures.

Analise OpenOffice XML format documents, as well as structured storage format documents, analyze powers, show scripts, websites need to know the artifacts and indicators of compromise and more prerequisites

you need to get moving. NBC and interests in revitalizes.

Some basic Linux knowledge will be helpful, but not strictly necessary.

Students who like to get started on a career path to become bell ringers, anyone eager to learn how to detect malicious documents.

Some of the tools that will be learned in this course are believed by the taxi to be deposited BBVA, Spider Monkey Yota or a who at times will be a viper monkey, lazy officinalis and more.

## 2. Learning Objectives

I'm going to introduce you to the objectives of malware analysis of documents.

With why malicious document, why is there a need to study this now, the authors will try the irritating thing off in order to get the malware installed in your system.

And out of all the techniques, the easiest way is to use social engineering, social engineering to you, try to manipulate the user to open a program or a document which will contain.

Nima Elbagir, if the attacker is using documents, then he will send a document to e-mail all to link. In an email or even put it up on the website and get the user to visit the site to click on the link, to download and document the document, your site will contain some probably some embedded scripts we shouldn't execute.

And the script is accurate and do something else. He will connect to the Internet and download the actual Malware. And this will be the second stage of the on the attack.

The first issue of the. Tricking the user to open the document itself and once the document is open, the script will activate and the for the bailouts from the Internet.

That would be the second stage. The same thing applies to links. If the attacker managed to get the user to click on links the link, then to download some documents

and then use them openly.  So once the malware is being stopped, the attacker will then have access to whatever was designed in the proverbial, whether it's ransomware or to steal information, install a back door. He's a bot or maybe as a proxy for launching further attacks to other nameless. So in Melbourne, this for documents, what we are looking for here.

Oh, you are asked to download second ballot this year can be embedded in the scripts or hidden in the document itself.

Oh, and then you also look for commands which the list contained within a script or inside the document. And these commands could be to use Bauscher to execute some commands or even JavaScript, as in the case for PDF and the script and so on. Authorities will be looking for Farnese embedded in the document or in the script.

So sometimes these findings could be obfuscated, even a script to obfuscate it. So in that case, we need to obfuscate it before we can understand what he's trying to do.

So the findings are important because he will tell you what type of file he's been downloaded and also where it is going to be safe to.

He may also give you a hint as to what is intended purpose. And once we get access to it and finally we can start looking for it when it is being done with it.

And then we can do secondary analyses on these files if you so desire. The next thing we'll be looking for are Embedded Files NHS, which contains the files that the NABAY

downloading a second stage on even embedded files in New Jersey within the document itself, and something to be able to look for. The MS imaging bite marks the existence of her B executable file. So in the next stage, before we do anything, we need to install which machines and which machines who allow you to conduct your analysis in a safe environment without compromising your host. And we need to counter with the machine. One is Microsoft Windows running Windows seven and the other one is running version HA Linux hologram,

which is specially created to analyze and malware. RAMNATH is necessary and contains all the tools necessary for reverse engineering as well as malware analysis and for the windows which are machine. We need it because we need to run the malware in order to do behavior analysis.
In the next video, we'll go ahead and start with the installation of the voting machines.
