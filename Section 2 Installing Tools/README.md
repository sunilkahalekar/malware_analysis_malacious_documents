## Installing windows VM

I will show you how to set up a lab for malware analysis. Why do we need to set up a lab in the first place?

Malware can damage your computer if you execute it. So we need a lab in order to have a safe environment that we can use to analyze and execute and run

malware also.  let me get your machine actually is able to be reset to its previous date. So after analyzing or executing malware, we can always reset it to his previous date.

And the previous date are snapshots. So we create snapshots before we analyze malware and we revert back to this snapshot after we finished the analysis.

Let's get started.

The requirements are as follows, we need to use virtual machine creator to create which machines and there are two popular ones Oracle Virtual Box. We read virtual boxes free and you can get it from this link here. On the other hand, we own way has got two versions. The first version, VMware Workstation Pro, is a 30 day trial. Once the 30 day trial expires, he will not be able to use it any longer. The second version is very workstation player. It is free but cannot create snapshots, so it is not suitable for our purpose. So either you go for virtual box or we may workstation pro, which is 30 days, but I wouldn't recommend it because after 30 days you can no longer use it. So if you are going to go for free and not ready to buy the license for the gaming workstation pro, then stick with your box, which is free. So the link is here and this is the website where you can just go ahead and click on the Windows host and download it.

After downloading it, you will get up and running it. You will get, windows, which look like this. As you can see on the left panel, I have already installed several which are machines. Next, you need to download ISO image with Windows seven, ultimate 32 bit working. Now, the reason why we need Windows seven, the little bit is because Windows seven has got a smaller footprint. You will find more samples targeting the Windows seven machine. Second reason is Windows seven machine is small, the size and footprint and less resource intensive competitive in those 10 and most malware is 32 bit, although there are also those targeting a 64 bit. So go for the Windows seven ultimate.

And then after that, you need to install the gas addition to use for the virtual machine, the gas addition to allow you to go full screen and also allow you to share folders, sharing folders is important because you want to transfer tools and files between your host computer and your guess your machine. Then we will look at how the check for the two to change fast speeding guest and host and also how to create a base snapshot of the virtual machine after configuring it.

Next, we will look at how to configure the virtual machine. In this case, your virtual machine is your Windows seven service pack, one ultimate 32 bit version. We will disable those Windows update, disable Windows Defender, which is the antivirus for Windows Disable, hiding all this file extensions and embouchure, all hidden files and folders disable he as our current. SLR is where you ready operating system randomise is the entry point for programs which are running. So we should disable it so that every time you want analyze, you will get the same entry point for the memory addresses.

Then we should also disable Windows firewall and finally create a snapshot. So the first step is to install the create new virtual machine after downloading Windows seven. You have Farnaby quite long. He has got the ISO extension. The file size is approximately three point eight gigabyte triploid gigabytes, so just rename it to make it shorter.

I call mine Windows seven. So this one Espie one just a little bit. I remember the location for this where you put it. You can place it somewhere convenient for you and then how we are going to go through the process of creating a new watch machine. Click on the machine and then click on New and over here, give a name for it called Windows seven.

Windows seven, Ultimate Hespe, one right to be. Then you can leave the machine for a default as it is and then go here and look for new settings, make sure it is selected as Windows seven, 72 bit. And then over here next. And this you can live it as a default if you have more ram, you can increase the ram size for in-memory. Maybe you can put two to zero for me and then click on next, and then you don't need to change anything,

just click on the create button and hear click on Nice Little Default I this and here live it as dynamically allocated and click on next. And they should be fine, as he said, dynamically group, truly klingler next. And now you can, uh, power it on and now you select, uh, start up this. So click on it and go and look for the new. I saw image.

I saw and go to the hotel where you download it, where you place your.

I so wish this man and he'd been.

And then click and just click and then click start. And the installation process has begun. You install it just like any operating systems or windows, you go through the whole process and this will take some time.

Just so we just let it run, and once he it has completed, we can stop the gas addition CD, so you are on the next king or you start.

Click accept the licensing agreement did not is Windows seven, ultimate espie one. Clicking on this. And King on custom and in here, Ali, unallocated space, click on next.

And he has begun copying files, so let it run. So I just let it run now and we will stop the video for now and I will see you in the next lesson and continue where we left off.
