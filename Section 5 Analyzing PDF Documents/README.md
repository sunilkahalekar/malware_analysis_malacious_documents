## 5.1 Introduction to Analysis of PDF Documents
Analysis PDF documents in this section, we are going to do a deep look into the analysis of documents.

You start off by studying the format of a PDF file.

Then we go to look at the things to look for during analysis.

Then we take a look at the tools that are used to find and extract data.

## 5.2 PDF Objects
Media objects far concedes internally of objects the objects can be classified into several sections there is he he hated.

The header is comprised of a series of strings percentage followed by P.D.A. Dash, followed by a version number four, this particular object.

There are many objects in the PDF document, but two of the important ones are the catalog object and extreme object.

Every section of an object, we have a stutt Keywood ending we take and Hinkie, for example, in the catalog, you can see objects and NBG.

In this 2.8, we also see the same thing starting Keywood, O'Bagy and ending Keywood and LBG and you can find some object, for example, stream and stream, the Catala object is of particular importance and interest because the object can have some directive, for example, to open something or execute something within the document itself.

The symbology, on the other hand, will contain might contain data which might be used by the catalog object.

Within each section of her video document, the object itself will contain the force, the identifier for the object, for example, the catalog is identified.

If no one and second number will be the version for this particular object. Same thing with the same object.

You will see it in front identifying these objects to object. So in this case, it is two and a second number.

Again, the version for this particular object. Now, each catalogue, object, object or any object in the document may refer to other sections within the within the PDF file itself.

By using these these ideas, for example, as you can see, indicate an object. The number two here refers to the same object which is found here to.

So this is how the big internally looks like in terms of objects.

## PDFA Keywords


Here, we are going to talk about PDAF key words. So what is bedcovers, PIDF keywords, those actions, elements that describe how P.D.A works.

In a previous we saw that a PDF file consists of various sections A, Section B, an object. And within each object we find keywords. So some of these keywords are listed here.

For example, the open action keyword or abbreviated is a function of which is to open an action to execute a script, for example.

The other one is JavaScript, abbreviated as. So this is a link to the JavaScript that will run when the PDF is open.

Another one will be names. So names are, for example, maybe names of files. And this is important to identifying additional files that may be referred to by the PDA documents it

We also have the embedded file Keywood, which will show where are the other files embedded within PDM document itself and which might contain scripts.

Then you also have the you are ikki with or some form keyword and these could be links to other. You are else on the Internet for the PDAF to go and download the second stage or additional to switch the malware needs to run.

And then we also have the launch keyword, which is similar to the open action keyword. And this launch keyword can be used to run scripts embedded within the email where the PDF file set out to run some new additional files that has been downloaded by the PDA.

So some of the tools that we'll be using will automatically scan for all of these keywords here. So you do not have to memorize them.
