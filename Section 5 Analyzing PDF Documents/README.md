Analysis PDF documents in this section, we are going to do a deep look into the analysis of documents.

You start off by studying the format of a PDF file.

Then we go to look at the things to look for during analysis.

Then we take a look at the tools that are used to find and extract data.

## 5.2 PDF Objects
Media objects far concedes internally of objects the objects can be classified into several sections there is he he hated.

The header is comprised of a series of strings percentage followed by P.D.A. Dash, followed by a version number four, this particular object.

There are many objects in the PDF document, but two of the important ones are the catalog object and extreme object.

Every section of an object, we have a stutt Keywood ending we take and Hinkie, for example, in the catalog, you can see objects and NBG.
